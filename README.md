![Design preview for the Launch countdown timer coding challenge](./design/Screenshot%20Frontend%20Mentor%20Launch%20countdown%20timer.png)

## Welcome! üëã

This is a solution to the [Launch countdown timer challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/launch-countdown-timer-N0XkGfyz-). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

**To do this challenge, you need a good understanding of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.**

## The challenge

The challenge is to build out this countdown timer and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

Users should be able to:

- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- See a live countdown timer that ticks down every second (start the count at 14 days)
- **Bonus**: When a number changes, make the card flip from the middle

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Accessibility
- [Sass/Scss](https://sass-lang.com/) - For styles

### Useful resources

- [chatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/) - This helped especially on the javascript side. I try not to depend on it as much and rather to find my own way so that i can learn.
